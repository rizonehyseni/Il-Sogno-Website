        <h2>Music Nights</h2>
        <p>
            Let the evening unfold with candlelight, fine food, and live music. 
            On our music nights, the lights dim, the melodies rise, and time slows down. 
            Whether it's a soft jazz serenade or a soulful acoustic set, every note adds 
            something special to your night. Come for the ambiance, stay for the feeling.
